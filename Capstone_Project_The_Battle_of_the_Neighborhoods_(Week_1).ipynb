        "TAIPEI (Taiwan News) â€“ According to statistics from 2017, Taiwan possesses the second highest ratio of convenience stores per population density of any country in the world. Taiwan's ratio of convenience stores is second only to South Korea, and barely ahead of Japan in third. There are 4 major convenience stores in Taiwan -- 7-11, Fami-mart, Hi-life, and OK-mart. \n",

Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening a new 7-11 in Taipei, Taiwan. The other convenience stores will not be concerned due to the high density. Having a different convenience store in neighborhood is very nature.\n",
